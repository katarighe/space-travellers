<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Space Travellers React Project <a name="about-project"></a>

The **Space Travellers React App** is a single-page application that allows users to browse and purchase books. It is built using the React JavaScript library and features a navbar and footer that provide navigation throughout the app. Users can register and login to create and manage their accounts, and they can add and remove books from a shopping cart. A search bar allows users to find books by title, author, or genre. A list of books that are currently in stock is also available, and each book has a page where users can view more information, such as the book's description, reviews, and price. Finally, users can view their past orders on an order history page.

The project is built with React, JSX, CSS, and JavaScript. It is also deployed on Heroku, so you can try it out by visiting the live demo.

The App is still under development, but it is a good example of how React can be used to build a dynamic and interactive web application. Some additional features that could be added to the app in the future include the ability to filter books by genre, price, or other criteria; the ability to add books to a wishlist; the ability to rate and review books; the ability to subscribe to email notifications about new books; the ability to purchase books in different currencies; and the ability to translate the app into different languages.
